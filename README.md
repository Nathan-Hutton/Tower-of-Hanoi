# Tower-of-Hanoi
Tower of Hanoi AI assignment implementing DFS, BFS, and A* methods as well as some associated methods

Most code was written by the Jingsai Liang. BFS, DFS, A*, and any methods that have the comment "#Your code goes here" was something that I wrote

This was also made in JupyterLab, so you may need to use that site for this code to work
